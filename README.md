# Mushroom Analysis
## *Objective: Predict if a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on certain characteristics*

**Machine Learning Goal**: Create a model that will return a True/False value based on certain characteristics, i.e., mushroom in question is edible ("True") or poisonous ("False").

## Week 1 Deliverables
1. Decide on a topic for project: Mushroom Analysis
    - Select a question: Is the described mushroom edible or not, i.e. is it poisonous?
2. Find preliminary datasets for your project: [link_to_Resources/mushroom_df_clean.csv](Resources/mushroom_df_clean.csv)
3. Perform rudimentary EDA on the datasets that have been found: [link_to_ETL_.ipynb](ETL_.ipynb)
4. Create a mockup of the database: (Beth) ![image_is_here](static/images/Mushroom_data.PNG)
5. Create a mockup of the machine learning model you are going to use: (Joshua and Julia)
	- Testing both Tensorflow and RandomForest for best results
		- [link_to_ML](machineLearning.ipynb) (Tensorflow)
		- [link_to_RF](RandomForest Machine Learning.ipynb) (RandomForest)
6. Technologies Selected:
	- SQL database (https://www.heroku.com/postgres)
	- Python (VS Code / Juypter Notebook)
	- Website (https://pages.github.com/)
