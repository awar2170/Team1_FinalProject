# Mushroom Analysis
Objective: Predict if a mushroom is poisonous or not based on certain characteristics

Machine Learning Goal: Create a model that will return a True/False value for if based on certain characteristics, if the mushroom in question is poisonous 

## Week 1 Deliverables
- Decide on a topic for project: Mushroom Analysis
    - Select a question: "Is a mushroom poisonous or not based on certain characteristics?"
- Find preliminary datasets for your project: Resources/mushroom_df_clean.csv
- Perform rudimentary EDA on the datasets that have been found: ETL.ipynb
- Create a mockup of the database: Resources/Mushroom_data_SQL.sql | static/images/Mushroom_data.PNG
- Create a mockup of the machine learning model you are going to use: 
	- Testing both Tensorflow and RandomForest for best results
		- machineLearning.ipynb (Tensorflow)
		- RandomForest Machine Learning.ipynb (RandomForest)
- Technologies Selected:
	- SQL database (https://www.heroku.com/postgres)
	- Python (VS Code / Juypter Notebook)
	- Website (https://pages.github.com/)
