Data Set Information
The primary data set contains descriptions of 173 mushroom species as entries. It can be used to simulate hypothetical mushrooms.

The secondary data set is a product of such simulation and contains 61,069 hypothetical mushrooms. It can be used for binary classification.

Secondary data (from website housing data)
Bookbased mushroom data set, describing physical characteristics, binary classification in poisonous or edible. Data Set Description Files are reported for two data sets: Primary and Secondary. The primary data set encodes the textbook mushroom entries, while the secondary data set is a pilot data, result of simulation. The secondary data may be used to achieve a binary classification using the Random Forests classifier (Accuracy and F2 score of 1).
