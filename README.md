# Mushroom Analysis
Objective: Predict if a mushroom is poisonous or not baded on certain characteristics

Machine Learning Goal: Create a model that will return a True/False value for if based on certain characteristics, if the mushroom in question is poisonous 

## Week 1 Deliverables
- Decide on a topic for project: Mushroom Analysis
    - Select a question: 
- Find preliminary datasets for your project: Team1_FinalProject/Resources/mushroom_df_clean.csv
- Perform rudimentary EDA on the datasets that have been found: ETL.ipynb
- Create a mockup of the database: (Beth)
- Create a mockup of the machine learning model you are going to use: (Joshua and Julia)
